# Membership Issuing / Transport Management System


<h2>Membership issuing and Transport management</h2>

<p>The MI/TMS is a system that issues and maintains users' memberships for a given transport company (which operates using mainly buses) and offers 
all of the standard functionality that such a system would entail. The deletion, issuing and updating of users' memberships
and their various properties (credit, details etc). The system also deals with types and subtypes of membership for different users. For example 
there are student memberships which will have discounts on trips and specific routes in a later version of the system, international memberships for tourists or those who 
travel frequently might also have a reduced overall fee the more they travel. Another component of the MI/TMS is that it manages the companies vehicles and their various subtypes, tracking capacity 
and registration numbers for administrative purposes. The system also records routes that buses could take, as well as the drivers and passengers
of a specific trip.</p> 

<h2>Employee management</h2>

<p>The employees are also managed via the system and are issued with staffID's and codes for their various subtypes (issuing staff,
drivers etc). An employees details and pay are also recorded and managed by the system. The system also keeps track of tasks that can be issued 
by managers and worked on by teams of employees with details such as due dates, task descriptions and the employees assigned to a specific task 
all being managed by the system. More functionality will be added in future with regard to tasks and the manager / employee classes associated
with task creation and management. The main focus of the employee management aspect of the system however, are not tasks but employees namely issuing staff
as they are resposible for issuing memberships and each have a unique issue number that can be used to identify individual employees if an error
occurs with regard to membership issuing.</p>

<h3>The most important items that are tracked in the system are as follows:</h3>

* MembeshipID
* StaffID
* VehicleRegistration
* TaskNumber
* RouteNumber (and name)
* TripNumber (and relevant data)
